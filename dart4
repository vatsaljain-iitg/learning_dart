1. Final variable can only be set once and it initialized only when accessed.
2. const variable is implicitly final but it is a compile-time constant, i.e. it is 
initialized only during compilation.
3. Instance variable can be final but cannot be constant.
4. If you want a constant at a Class level then you have to make it a static constant.
